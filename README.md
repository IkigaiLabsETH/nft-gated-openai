# NFT Gated Website

This project demonstrates how you can restrict content on your website to only those users who own a token of your choice (any ERC-20, ERC-721 or ERC-1155).

You can use any token you like regardless if it's deployed using thirdweb or not. However, if the contract wasn't deployed on thirdweb initially, make sure you import the contract on the thirdweb dashboard.

## Installation

Install via [thirdweb create](https://portal.thirdweb.com/cli/create)

```bash
  npx thirdweb create --template nft-gated-website
```

Edit smart contract details in `const/yourDetails.js`

## Run Locally

```bash
  # npm
  npm install

  # yarn
  yarn install

Start the server

```bash
  # npm
  npm run start

  # yarn
